# FoodWasteRescue

> Turning surplus food in Myrtle Beach into community meals

FoodWasteRescue is a React Native app backed by Supabase that helps local restaurants, grocery stores, and bakeries post real-time surplus food alerts and connect with volunteers and nonprofits to rescue it. By streamlining pickups and tracking impact, we reduce waste, lower landfill emissions, and feed those in need.

## How It Works

1. **Post Surplus**  
   Businesses snap a photo, enter a brief description (e.g. “5 loaves of day-old bread”), weight estimate, pickup window, and location—then hit **Post**.  
2. **Claim Alert**  
   Volunteers browse open alerts in a map or list view, tap **Claim** to reserve a pickup, and coordinate via in-app chat or SMS.  
3. **Rescue & Deliver**  
   Rescued items are delivered to partner shelters, community fridges, and food banks.  
4. **Track Impact**  
   An admin dashboard aggregates metrics—pounds rescued, CO₂ saved, and active partners—to showcase our community’s impact.
